# Introduction

MCP Starter is a template for building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It demonstrates best practices for creating tools, resources, and prompts that LLMs can effectively use.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables LLMs to interact with external systems through standardized tools, resources, and prompts. Think of it as an API specifically designed for AI agents.

## What This Template Provides

- **Working MCP Server**: Query this template to learn about MCP patterns
- **Code Examples**: All patterns demonstrated in actual code
- **Testing Framework**: Evalite integration for validating LLM behavior
- **Boilerplate Generation**: Generate new tools/resources from templates

## When to Use This Template

Use this when building MCP servers that:

- Expose documentation or knowledge bases
- Provide code exploration capabilities
- Need search and filtering tools
- Require LLM-friendly error handling
